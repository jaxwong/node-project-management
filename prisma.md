### Learn

1. Consult prisma official docs to use prisma, use ESM over CJS
2. PrismaClient is autogenerated from `schema.prisma` with `npx prisma generate` and contains a property for each model in the db
3. Every model in Prisma generates `prisma.modelName.operation()`
4. Query object structure:
    ```ts
    prisma.model.operation({
    where: {...},
    data: {...},
    include: {...},
    select: {...},
    orderBy: {...},
    take: 10,
    skip: 5,
    });
    ```
5. Everything in Prisma is strongly typed
    - can't insert invalid fields
    - the return tyoe of every Prisma call is inferred automatically
